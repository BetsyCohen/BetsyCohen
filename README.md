## Hi I'm Betsy 👋

🏛️ I am a sociologist (UBA) and data analyst. My goal is to help people make decisions by creating a data-driven culture that opens them up to new perspectives.
👩🏻‍🎓 I am currently a student of the Master's Degree in Statistics

I'm part of the organizer team in Raldies Buenos Aires, a global organization that promotes Gender Diversity in the R community, and I also participate in Núcleo de Innovación Social an interdisciplinary research and development hub in sociology and tech.
